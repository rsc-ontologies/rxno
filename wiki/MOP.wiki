#summary Overview of the Molecular Process ontology

= Introduction =

The Molecular Process ontology is a description of processes at the molecular level cross-referenced with [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi ChEBI] where possible.


= Details =

The ontology has three main sources.

  * Many of the definitions are based on those in the [http://goldbook.iupac.org/ the IUPAC Gold Book]. The classifications, on the hand, are original to MOP.
  * The descendants of the classes "breaking of covalent bond with group" (MOP:0000567) and "formation of covalent bond with group" (MOP:0000566) have been automatically generated and are based on ChEBI. Note that this work was done before the existence of MIREOT, and hence the cross-references are far from complete.
  * The reactions described by Baldwin's rules have been added as children of "endocyclization" (MOP:0000771) and "exocyclization" (MOP:0000772).
