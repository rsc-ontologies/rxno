These two files where genereate as layed out in [27#issuecomment-1091415293](https://github.com/rsc-ontologies/rxno/issues/27#issuecomment-1091415293).
They were created to resolve the [issue#72](https://github.com/rsc-ontologies/rxno/issues/27) with some classes of MOP being declared twice, once in mop.owl and once in rxno.owl. 
The detailed documentation of what has been done with each conflicting class in the PR draft #... is inside the Excel file. 
The TSV thus records the *ID, label* and *SubclassOf axioms* of the conflicting MOP classes within *2022-02-01/mop.owl* & *2021-12-16/rxno.owl*
